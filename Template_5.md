**Why are you applying for Financial Aid..?**

Hi.! This is Lakshmi Kiranmai. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in some YYY Branch at an XXXXX college in India. Studying at this college cost me more than $ 3000 every year. My dad works very hard in order to fulfill my needs but he can bring home only $430 every month. So It's very difficult for him to manage the home needs as well as pay my tuition and hostel fees. I also had a sister she was also studying in the other college. All the money he has been saving goes for the payment of our fees. He tries his best to provide us with the best of education. I was referred to this course by one of my friends in our college. After knowing this course immediately I checked the syllabus and found it interesting. Apart from that, it's a great opportunity to learn from the highly experienced professors from the world-class universities and Organisations so, I don't want to miss this golden opportunity but at the same time, it's very difficult for me to ask my parents for financial help as they have done enough for me. I don't want to add more burden for them with the basket of problems. Therefore I kindly request Coursera through this platform to consider my application and grant me financial aid to complete this course. I promise that I won't take this opportunity for granted and work hard to learn more and more to gain more knowledge.
