**Q1)Why are you applying for Financial Aid?**

I am in my last year of B.Tech in a Tier 2 college in India. I am currently unemployed and I am yet to be placed in my college. My father is a farmer in a rural area in India. 
He earns around 140 USD a month. My mother is a homemaker who keeps assisting my father. This course is therefore too expensive for me to afford. My father is working under a 
landlord and we owe no land. Besides this I have two other siblings who are in high schools. To add to our misery my grandmother remains sick most of the times . A lot of money 
gets spent in her medical check ups and medicines. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid.I want to take this course as I want to learn.This Course will boost my job prospects
after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in understanding and learning this technology and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will
attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also I
intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade
assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.

**Q2)How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?**

My main career goal is to learn every day. I really want to learn and to progress in my career. Programming requires constant learning and improving. Taking this course will

Networks and Deep Learning ,understanding how Neural Networks and Deep Learning could potentially impact our business and industry,to write a thought leadership piece regarding 
use cases and industry potential of Neural Networks and Deep Learning ,explain Neural Networks and Deep Learning to clients, friends,joining a community of economists, business 
leaders, entrepreneurs, and technologists that are shaping this as we speak.Identifying which aspects of Neural Networks and Deep Learning seem most important and relevant to us,
Walking away with a strong foundation in where Neural Networks and Deep Learning is going, what it does, and how to prepare for it. Neural Networks and Deep Learning course will
