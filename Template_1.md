**Why are you applying for Financial Aid?**

I am a student of B.Sc (Hons.) Computer Science at Sri Sri University. I do not have any source of income to pay for this course. I belong to a lower-middle-class India family 
and cannot afford to pay for this course. I did the first course in this specialization Programming for Everyone (Getting Started with Python) through the financial aid provided
by the Coursera. I found it helpful for my career as a Data Scientist. Receiving this Financial Aid will open a new horizon of the world of Coursera courses for me. That, in turn,
will help me in future goal and building a successful career. I also plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in the previous course. The Finacial Aid 
will only push me further towards my goals and my dreams of one day having a successful career as a Data Scientist.

**How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?**
I am pursuing B.Sc (Hons.) Computer Science from Sri Sri University. I want to complete the course as I found the course helpful for my career and also that I can put a good CV to 
get applied to a job. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from University. It will help perform better in my career as a Data Scientist and give me an edge 
over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. Completing this course will boost my self-confidence, knowing
that I not only completed a very important task but also took the responsibility of creating a foundation for getting me closer to my career goals. Also, I intend to participate
in Discussion Forums, that I have found to supplement my learning immensely. I also plan to grade assignments, which are to peer-reviewed, which I believe will an invaluable
learning opportunity.

**If you answered no, please help us understand why?**
The financial status of the family is not too good to pay the loan amount. We already have a lot of dept in the bank, and my parents are paying it regularly. It would make their 
life even harder to add a new loan over them. I don't want to put any pressure over them. It would be a great help for me to get a good job and help my family if I'm able to get 
this course.
