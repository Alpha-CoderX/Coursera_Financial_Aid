**why are you applying for financial aid?**

I am a student in JNVU university but due to financial issues I was unable to pursue courses that were available offline and here on Coursera I have a chance to learn a new thing 
but I can't afford the courses because I am already working hard to meet my daily needs and because of this COVID 19 my company is not going to pay me the salary of the month so 
I will have to adjust everything on my pocket money for my bread and milk. My parents are in their old age so I have to take care of them also even for there medicines.

As a student, I can only ask you to help me in learning new things. Therefore I kindly request Coursera through this platform to consider my application and grant me financial aid 
to complete this course. I promise that I won't take this opportunity for granted and work hard to learn more and more to gain more knowledge.

**How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals ?**

As I am working in Export Industry knowledge of International business which I will be able to learn from Coursera would really help me in solving problems and to show innovative
ways to my company which will eventually increase their revenues so as my salary and if my salary will increase I will be able to support my families and there dream which they 
also want to fulfill, because a man with empty pockets cannot buy them anything.

If you want to be in the market you will have to be a knowledgable person because there is no value of a person if he doesn't know anything. This course will definitely help me in 
achieving my career goals. Therefore I kindly request Coursera through this platform to consider my application and grant me financial aid to complete this course. I promise that'
I won't take this opportunity for granted and work hard to learn more and more to gain more knowledge.

**If you answered no, please help us understand why.**

I could have opted for a low-interest loan but I would really be unable to spare more amount because I have my parents who are dependent on me and I have to take care of their
medicines because it is my duty and also because of this COVID19 I will not be receiving the salary till the market remain lockdown. If I will enhance my quality and talent then 
I will be receiving more salary and then I will be able to fulfill every need of my family members. because all that matters to us is our family. I won't lie to you to learn the 
things which will even help to make my family life better.
