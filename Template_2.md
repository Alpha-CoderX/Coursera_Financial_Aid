**Why are you applying for Financial Aid?**
I am a resident of India. My father is a daily wage labourer and mother is a housewife. Our annual income is pretty low wrt to the average nation’s income. I think it will be 
beneficial for me to get into the firm as an intern. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expanses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship.
In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact
on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. Receiving this Financial Aid will open for me a new horizon of the world of Coursera courses, which in 
turn will help me in future. I also plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in 
Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments, which are to
peer-reviewed, which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.

**How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?**
I want to take this course as I want to learn Data science. I want to complete the course due to my curiosity and also that I can put a good CV to get applied to a job. This 
course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in carrying out various programs in a computer language and give me an edge 
over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. The field of software technology is becoming saturated, and 
industries are now placing a high level of importance on specialisation. This course is suggested by one of my seniors. I'm a junior in college and form next semester I have my 
placement pool. Getting certification on this course not only help me to stand out among thousands but also help my resume get shortlisted and get high pay job as top companies 
are using data science and it has been said that up to 2020 the world will be going to generate 50 times more data than what generated in 2011, so many companies are looking for 
Data Scientists. There is a lot of potential and scope in this career opportunity.

**If you answered no, please help us understand why?**
Sir, the financial status of the family, is not too good to pay the loan amount. We already have a lot of dept in the bank, and my parents are paying it regularly. It would make 
their life even harder to add a new loan over them. Sir, I don't want to put any pressure over them. Sir, it would be a great help for me to get a good job and help my family if
I'm able to get this course.
